# jQuery Spotify Add to Playlist Plugin
Simple plugin to allow a user to add a track to a Spotify playlist. If the playlist doesn't exist, it gets created and if it already exists, the song just gets added to it.

Note: this plugin is heavily based on the good work of https://github.com/possan/playlistcreator-example
